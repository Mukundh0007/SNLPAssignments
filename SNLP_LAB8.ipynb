The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \\\"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\\\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\",\n          \"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the\\u00a0phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.\",\n          \"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with\\u00a0operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,'\\u00a0as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before\\u00a0Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first \\u2013 this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone \\u2013 I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we\\u2019re going to change the narrative \\u2013 the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won\\u2019t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won\\u2019t. Congress sure won\\u2019t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It\\u2019s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we\\u2019re going to define exactly what reform means \\u2013 set a written standard \\u2013 and it\\u2019s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk \\u2018reform\\u2019 but won\\u2019t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That\\u2019s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the \\u2018Honor Roll\\u2019 on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn\\u2019t listed there \\u2013 it\\u2019s my own startup group:\\u2018The Civilist Papers\\u2018. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We\\u2019re not after money \\u2013 we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

Paris Ainsworth, 51, was shot four times in the late-night attack, but was able to return fire with eight bullets from her licensed .45 caliber handgun. The health worker said her weapon saved her life. 'If I wouldn't have had my gun I would be dead today,' the grandmother-of-four told WDIV. 'This is ludicrous, the way that they are just robbing and trying to take stuff from people, and killing people.' Survivor: Grandmother-of-four Paris Ainsworth, 51, said she fired at two robbers who shot her four times outside her Detroit home on the weekend . Tough: Paris Ainsworth, 51 (pictured left and right) said she had just returned to her Detroit home when two men threatened her with guns . Ainsworth said she was returning home to the 15400 block of Beaverland from a double shift on the weekend, when she saw two men approaching her. She said she slipped her handgun into her pocket before she got out of the car. She said one of the men then shot her four times - three in the side and once in the hand. 'He said, 'Don't pull it,' and he shot immediately',' Ainsworth said. Ainsworth then pulled out her gun and fired. 'I said, 'You mother (expletive),' and pulled out (my gun) and started shooting. One, he was right in the middle of the street. The other one was right here on the (side of the street),' she said. When the alleged attackers fled, Ainsworth waited on a neighbor's porch until EMS arrived. 'I kept applying pressure to my side and where the blood was coming from,' she said. Scene: Paris Ainsworth was shot four times in the driveway of her home on the 15400 block of Beaverland in Detroit (pictured) Treatment: Paris Ainsworth was taken to Sinai-Grace Hospital in west Detroit (pictured) for treatment, the same place where her two alleged attackers showed up and were arrested . The Detroit resident was rushed to Sinai-Grace Hospital for treatment - the same place where her alleged attackers were arrested. One of the attackers was shot in both legs. 'The victim told officers that she fired her handgun at the suspects when they attempted to rob her and did not know if the shots took effect,' Detroit police said in a statement, according to UPI. 'While at the scene, another police run was called in from the hospital stating that a male was shot. The officers went to the hospital and the male that was shot matched the description given by the victim.' Ainsworth said the attack brought back memories of being hit with a gun by a mugger 10 years ago. Two years ago, she got a concealed weapons permit, believing that people have a right to protect themselves with guns. 'He (the weekend attacker) didn't shoot me because he felt that I was going to shoot him. He didn't care. He just shot. He didn't look like, 'Oh my God I shouldn't have.' He just had the devil in him,' she said. 'I thank God that I'm here with my family. It was horrible. I never want to see anything like that again.' 'No man, no law, no war can stop him': Grandmother-of-four Paris Ainsworth, 51, has been dubbed 'Rambo' - the gun-toting character played by Sylvester Stallone - for fighting off two alleged attackers with a pistol .\",\n          \"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:00 EST, 21 October 2013 . Bridget Jones fans reacted with sadness and fury when it was revealed that the beloved character\\u00a0 Mr Darcy had been killed off in Helen Fielding's latest novel, Mad About The Boy. Now the author has revealed why she felt her heroine had to find herself suddenly single again at the age of 51 with two children. She explains in a video you can watch below: 'I . wrote this book from the inside out, that is what happened, Mark died. No-one gets to Bridget's age without suffering some sort of loss, life . doesn't turn out as you expect.' Scroll down for video . 'Life doesn't turn out as you expect': Author Helen Fielding explains why character Mark Darcy is dead in her latest Bridget Jones novel . No happy ending: Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger, is a widow following the loss of Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth . The 55-year-old British writer said she also had to do something to make the book sufficiently different from the previous two novels in which hapless Bridget finally found love with the dashing lawyer. 'I didn't want this book to be a . weak copy of the other books,' she said. And despite the sad subject matter of Bridget becoming a widow, Fielding said the book is still funny and uplifting. Daniel is back: Fielding said she kept the character played by Hugh Grant, right, because 'an ex can become a friend' 'The thing about Bridget is the comedy . has always come from something real,' she explained. 'Tough things happen in life and she gets . through and she survives, she had her friends, she deals with it and she . comes through the other side and she's still finding things funny. 'It . hurts but she's still laughing, that was something important that I . wanted to say.' But while Mr Darcy - who was played by Colin Firth - in the films will only be referred to in flashbacks in the new book, Fielding was keen to ensure the character Daniel Cleaver still had a starring role. He was the lovable rogue who cheated on Bridget and almost cost her her happy relationship with Darcy. So it is plausible they would still be friends decades later? Fielding believes so. 'The . thing about Daniel is, people do stay in people's lives, old boyfriends . do become friends. Not all sad: Fielding said the new novel still has humour despite the loss of Bridget's husband . Still mad about Bridget: The book has been selling well despite poor reviews . 'He's still Daniel saying \\\"what colour are your . panties\\\" and having a crack at seduction but he's still in her life and . they accept each other as they are.' Fielding concedes his inclusion is also because she has a soft spot for the character - which was increased after Hugh Grant played him so charmingly in the film adaptations, adding his own improvised lines to the script. She said: 'I love Daniel as a character and I . love Hugh as a character. Hugh contributed a huge amount to the funny . lines in the movie. 'For example when he's seducing Bridget and she's . wearing the big pants, and he says \\\"don't worry, I'm wearing something . similar myself\\\" and \\\"oh mummy!\\\" that came from him. 'So I really wanted to . keep him present and he's now godfather to Bridget's children.' Despite some mediocre reviews and the loss of Mr Darcy, Mad About The Boy has still been snapped up by readers, topping the hardback chart the week it went on sale.\",\n          \"By .

Protesters demanded criminal charges against Officer Darren Wilson, who some witnesses said shot and killed Brown while he was surrendering with his hands up. But police said Wilson shot Brown after the 18-year-old attacked him and tried to take his service gun in August. Demonstrators also sought for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch to recuse himself from overseeing the case because, they allege, he can't be impartial after his police officer father was killed on the job by a black man in 1964. McCulloch rejected those demands. But he said he will not try the case if there is an indictment.  Meanwhile, two assistant prosecuting attorneys have been assigned to the case. Here are key five things you'll want to know as the legal system moves forward: . 1. What kinds of charges are the grand jury considering? It's not just one potential crime. The grand jury is deciding whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, said Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office. The grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges, and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action, authorities said. At the same time, the grand jury will receive the Missouri statutes for self-defense and the police use of deadly force. 2. How many votes are needed on a grand jury to issue an indictment? There are 12 members on the Missouri grand jury (some other states have different numbers), and nine of the 12 must vote yes to indict someone. The grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret. The same goes for the grand jurors' race or ethnicity. 3. Does the grand jury have a deadline? Yes, the grand jury has until January 7 to make its decision. But the prosecutor's office says there could be a decision by mid-November. 4. How often does it meet? Normally a grand jury in St. Louis County meets every Wednesday. But the grand jury has been extended for the Brown case so jurors have extra time to hear from a number of witnesses and to focus solely on this case. In this scenario, the panel is allowed to meet on days when all 12 jurors can get together. Once agreed upon, the schedule is given to the prosecuting attorney's office. 5. Has the grand jury received all the evidence yet? No, according to the prosecutor's office. They have not heard from all the witnesses. Some witnesses are still reluctant to cooperate, the prosecutor's office said. Ultimately, witnesses can be compelled to appear to the grand jury by subpoena. In past statements, McCulloch has promised a fair and thorough investigation. \\\"We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury. Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we'll go from there,\\\" McCulloch told KTRS in August.\",\n          \"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 19 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:55 EST, 19 November 2013 . This tiny koala has spent the past six months tucked up cosy and warm in its mum\\u2019s pouch. And as it poked its sleepy head out, the joey seemed reluctant to venture much further into the chill Edinburgh air. Britain\\u2019s first-ever joey, which was born at the city\\u2019s zoo in May, emerged fully from the pouch of his mother Alinga for the first time at the weekend. This koala, Britain's first-ever joey, emerged fully from the pouch of his mother for the first time this weekend . Alinga, the joey's mother, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February . Its sex has not yet been determined by its keepers. Zoo spokesman Lorna Hughes said: \\u2018A lot of people expected the joey to just suddenly appear one day but the process has been more\\u00a0gradual. \\u2018The first thing we saw was a pink arm poking out, with no fur. Now the whole joey is starting to come out and we can see it has developed a beautiful grey fur coat.\\u2019 Born blind with no ears or fur, it has spent the past six months developing in Alinga's pouch. After growing almost all of its fur, the creature recently became active at night and started climbing on its mother's back. Zoo keepers monitored the youngster's late night activity on CCTV but excited zoo visitors were limited to the odd glimpse of a nose or arm. Born blind with no ears or fur, the joey has spent the past six months developing in its mother's pouch . The joey finally emerged in daylight for the first time on Sunday and is now set to be a star attraction at the zoo. Koalas are marsupials native to the southern and eastern coasts of Australia and Edinburgh is the only British zoo housing any. Alinga, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February. She fell pregnant during her first introduction to male Goonaroo. Koalas are marsupials native to Australia and now Edinburgh is the only British zoo housing any . The zoo's head of living collections, Darren McGarry, said: \\u2018As koalas are solitary animals, bringing them together for mating required a lot of skill. \\u2018So for Alinga to breed successfully, on the first attempt is a great accomplishment for the team. \\u2018We have worked with koalas for eight years now and everybody is completed devoted to their care. \\u2018Each of our three adult koalas - Alinga, Goonaroo and Yabbra - have very distinct characters and we cannot wait to see what sort of character our little joey has.\\u2019 Alinga will carry the joey on her back until it is aged around one. When it reaches sexual maturity at around two, the joey will begin a breeding programme. Alinga, who has been in Edinburgh for just less than a year, will carry the joey on her back until it is aged one . If it is female it may stay at Edinburgh Zoo to breed with male Yabbra. But if it is male it will be moved elsewhere in Europe. Edinburgh Zoo has been part of the European breeding programme for koalas for eight years. Despite being one of Australia's most iconic animals, koala numbers are in decline in the country due to habitat loss. A koala's diet consists solely of Eucalyptus leaves, a plant that is toxic to most other animals. The Edinburgh Zoo koalas receive a wide variety of Eucalyptus species fresh every day.

NASA launches a rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Tuesday. \\\"We could not make orbit,\\\" NASA program manager John Brunschwyler said. \\\"Initial indications are the vehicle did not have enough [force] to reach orbit and landed just short of Antarctica in the ocean.\\\" \\\"Certainly for the science community, it's a huge disappointment.\\\" The satellite, which would have monitored greenhouse gases to study how they affect the Earth's climate, was launched on a Taurus XL rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:55 a.m. PT (4:55 a.m. ET). But the payload fairing -- a clamshell-shaped structure that allows the satellite to travel through space -- failed to separate from the rocket, NASA officials said.  See video of launch \\u00bb . The weight of the fairing caused the rocket and the satellite to come crashing down to Earth about three minutes later. A team of investigators will look into what caused the payload fairing to fail to separate. \\\"We'll get back to flying at a pace that allows us to do so successfully,\\\" said Chuck Dovale, NASA Launch Director, at a press briefing after the failed launch. The $273 million satellite, called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, would have collected global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere to help better forecast changes in carbon-dioxide levels and their effect on the Earth's climate. Carbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas because it traps heat, which scientists believe contributes to the warming of the planet. Carbon dioxide also absorbs wavelengths of light, and the NASA observatory would have measured levels of the gas partly by using instruments to analyze light reflected off the Earth. The OCO also would have provided information about CO2 \\\"sinks\\\" -- areas, like oceans or landfills, that absorb and store carbon dioxide. NASA officials said all measurements would be combined with the findings of ground observation stations, providing a more complete account of the human and natural sources of CO2. The OCO project took eight years to develop, said Michael Frelich, director of the NASA Earth Science Division. Its failure is a great loss for the science community, he said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28652,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The grand jury in Missouri is looking at several potential crimes, not just one .\\nThe grand jury has been given permission to set its own schedule .\\nGrand jurors have until January to make a decision .\",\n          \"Britain's first joey emerged fully from pouch of mother Alinga on Sunday .\\nBorn with no ears or fur in May, its sex has not yet been determined .\\nCreature, living in Edinburgh's zoo, recently became active at night .\",\n          \"NEW: Satellite crashed into ocean near Antarctica minutes after launch, NASA says .\\n$273 million project was intended to study effect of greenhouse gases .\\nNASA: Investigators will probe why fairing failed to separate from rocket .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

What started as a nonthreatening and seemingly shrinking grass fire on Sunday, consuming fewer than 100 acres according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Al Cruz, grew to be more than 10 times that within the next 24 hours. By Monday night, the fire had burned nearly 2,000 acres and was 50% contained, the fire department said. High temperatures and gusty winds helped the fire spread, State Forester Jim Karels said. Several fire units and a helicopter with the capacity to drop 400 gallons of water at a time were battling the blaze, Cruz said. \\\"The Florida Forest Service and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue have worked around the clock to protect Southwest Miami-Dade County,\\\" Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam H. Putnam said in a statement. Early Monday night, officials were considering road closures, and one school, Lincoln Marti, was evacuated as a precaution, according to the Fire Department.\",\n          \"A 30-stone Texan woman has used her eight-foot belly to entice men from around the world, including latest hubby, Lance. Gayla Neufeld, 52, struggled to deal with her family's unusual legacy of piling weight around the midriff for years. But the happy couple, who live in Manitoba, Canada, are now using Gayla's 96-inch asset to launch her new career - as an international webcam model. Scroll down for video . 30 stone Gayla Neufeld met her truck driver husband Lance on a fat-fetish forum . She said: 'Growing up I used to be ashamed of my belly but now I have a great following of men who really like it. 'There have been men from all over the world. I have had doctors, lawyers and even bodybuilders, lots of bodybuilders, approach me, which really amazed me. 'They tell me it's the perfect belly. They say it's not marred or scarred and that they love the shape of it because it is a single belly. Some larger women they have a double-layer or a two-tier belly but mine is a single. That is really attractive to a lot of men.' The 52-year-old says men love her 'perfect belly' and she gets approached by bodybuilders and doctors . Thirty stone Gayla wasn't always so body-confident and for years she struggled to deal with her family's unusual genetic legacy. 'Women in my family have always gained weight around the belly, especially after having children,' said Gayla, whose favourite foods are homemade cookies and ice-cream. 'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother. Gayla inherited her big belly from her family.\\u00a0'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother,' she said . Aged eight, Gayla already weighted 13 stone. She used to get bullied at school and felt ashamed of her weight . 'Growing up, kids at school would point and laugh at me and say \\\"boom, boom, boom\\\" with every step I took. I was really ashamed to be fat.' Aged eight, Gayla already weighed a whopping 13st and continued to pile on even more weight in her teens. One doctor even prescribed her amphetamines to curb her sweet tooth, but it failed and made her even more depressed. Her burgeoning curves made her popular with boys at high school, though, and Gayla had many admirers - but she was too embarrassed at the thought of being naked. Despite her body issues she eventually married at 19 and embarked on a mission to battle the bulge. Gayla's curves attracted boys when she was a teenager, and she married at the age of 19 . However, her husband was embarassed by her size as she continued to pile on the pounds, and they divorced . But instead of maintaining any weight loss, she found herself hovering between 21 and 28 stone. Her wavering confidence was further diminished when her husband said he was embarrassed by her weight and they divorced in 1999. It was at rock-bottom that Gayla discovered an online community of obese women calling themselves SSBBWs - meaning 'super-sized big beautiful women'. These curvaceous women - some in excess of 40 stone - were worshipped by legions of men calling themselves 'fat admirers'. An online community for fat women helped Gayla to embrace her size as she was worshiped by 'fat admirers' Curious to know more, Gayla joined a forum called Bulge Chat and soon found herself overwhelmed with lusty fans. She said: 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was. 'I had always thought the men who liked BBWs would be geeks in their mum's basement, but I was totally wrong.' Despite having her pick it was rugged truck driver Lance Neufield, 54, who really caught her attention. 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was,' said Gayla . After meeting on Bulge Chat they enjoyed two 15-minute conversations and struck up an instant\\u00a0rapport. Lance told her he was driving to Texas with work the following week and they agreed to meet at a truck stop and have dinner. Gayla agreed despite vowing never to fall for anyone again - and she found herself swept off her feet by the Canadian. She said: 'When he pulled up and I saw him I was like, 'Oh my God, he is so cute'. 'He got in the car and he said to me, 'Your pictures online do you no justice'. I was like, 'Aww, that's so sweet' and I just blushed. When Lance and Gayla first met, they stayed up all night talking and smooching on the sofa . 'Years later I found out that his computer didn't produce very good pictures, but it's okay, it still made me feel good at the time. 'We had our first dinner and got a bottle of Champagne afterwards and rented the General's Daughter and The Thomas Crown Affair. 'We didn't get through any of those movies because we stayed up all night talking and smooching on the couch like a couple of kids. 'I was sad when he had to go.' They embarked on a long-distance relationship before Gayla agreed to move to Manitoba, Canada, to be with Lance - and they married six years later. Gayla moved from Texas to Canada to be with Lance, and they married six years later . Despite her size, they claim to enjoy an 'active and satisfying sex life', though Gayla's weight causes other day-to-day obstacles. She struggles to shop for clothes that fit around her 96-inch belly and must use a motorised cart if required to walk long distances. Getting into a car is also an ordeal and she must book two seats on an aeroplane when flying. She has a range of health issues including arthritis and thyroid problems, but remains upbeat about the future. Gayla struggles to walk long distances and has to book two seats on an aeroplane when flying . She said: 'As far as the health aspects go, I don't really worry about them. My mother is still alive and she is 82. 'I have had doctors tell me more then once that I needed to lose weight for health reasons but I truly\\u00a0believe that when it is your time to go, it is your time to go.' Lance, who has three children from a previous relationship, has always been attracted to Gayla's supersize paunch but wouldn't stand in her way if she attempted to lose weight. Gayla's favourite foods are cookies and ice-cream. She says she doesn't worry about health problems . He said: 'This woman is the love of my life. I would 100% support her if she decided to lose weight. 'The first thing that attracted me to her was that she had the most beautiful face I had ever seen. 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty. 'It doesn't matter to me whether it is bigger or smaller because it's not really her belly I love - I love her.' 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty,' says Gayla's latest husband, Lance . With Lance's continuing support Gayla is planning to continue her modelling career and win over even more fans. She said: 'I allowed the world to dictate to me what I was supposed to look like and who I was supposed to be. By taking a body-positive image I have empowered myself to be who I am and to enjoy my life. 'I'm not going to tell you that I never have bad days and I am not going to tell you that I don't wish I was thin from time to time, but mostly I just enjoy being me. 'You've got to love who you are.'\",\n          \"Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet \\u2014 in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves \\u2014 to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius \\u2014 the biggest rabbit on earth \\u2014 and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft . Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st \\u2014 the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record \\u2014 and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record \\u2014 and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff . Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: \\u00a310 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius \\u2014 recently given a clean bill of health by vets \\u2014 seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up \\u2014 it's like lifting a hefty toddler \\u2014 that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them \\u2014 they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models \\u2014 'mostly magazine work' \\u2014 and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto \\u2014 they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked \\u2014 they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving \\u2014 and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition \\u2014 and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise \\u2014 left to their own devices \\u2014 can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . 'That's cruel \\u2014 it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] \\u2014 although it's the damp you should be more worried about \\u2014 it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost \\u00a3500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television \\u2014 including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11449,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The wildfire started in Miami-Dade County on Sunday .\\nBy Monday night, it had grown to nearly 2,000 acres .\\nThe fire was 50% contained, officials said .\",\n          \"30-stone woman's 'perfect belly' attracted men from around the world .\\nGayla Neufeld always struggled with her size, weighing 13 stone aged eight .\\nThe 52-year-old\\u00a0now embraces her belly and works as a webcam model .\\nTexan Gayla met her husband Lance, from Canada, on a fat-fetish forum .\",\n          \"Annette Edwards has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years .\\nShe claims the secret to breeding huge rabbits is both parents must be big .\\nThe former Playboy model has owned the world's largest rabbit since 2008 .\\nHer rabbit Darius is 4ft in length but he will soon be eclipsed by his son .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Costa\\u2019s hamstring injury meant Valencia\\u2019s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9. Dream start: David Silva jumps on to Paco Alcacer's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Macedonia in Valencia . Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57).

Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down \\u2013 the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain\\u2019s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain\\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors\\u2019 defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain \\u2013 of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more. Back in the game: Ibraimi's Macedonian team-mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by Juanfran .

Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar \\u2013 this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Bar\\u00e7a\\u2019s B-team last season. His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown.

Spain's supremacy in midfield: Chelsea man Fabregas helped the home side to take control at the Ciutat de Valencia stadium against the hardworking Macedonians .\",\n          \"(CNN) -- For decades, comic books have had major shake-ups in their pages, with varying degrees of fan support -- and outrage. In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Andrew McGaughey, 65, buried to his neck when ground gave way .\\nWas renovating Spanish holiday home where he was planning to retire .\\nFather-of-two was dead by the time paramedics arrived .\",\n          \"Spain started with eight players from the Euro 2012 campaign - Vincente Del Bosque didn't make too many changes .\\nSergio Ramos scored opener for Spain with a cheeky paneka chipped penalty after David Silva was brought down .\\nPaco Alcacer doubled the lead after Juanfran beat the goalkeeper to a chipped cross that went across the area .\\nJuanfran then gave away a penalty allowing Agim Ibraimi to halve the deficit from the spot past Iker Casillas .\\nSergio Busquets restored the two-goal cushion with a low deflected strike just before the half-time whistle .\\nSilva's low strike across the goalkeeper made it 4-1 to Spain as they showed their style in this big win .\\nCesc Fabregas had the chance to make it five but he thumped the crossbar after getting to Jordi Alba's cross .\\nBarcelona youngster Munir El Haddadi came on for the last 23 minutes for his debut to cap a dream few weeks .\\nPedro chipped in with the fifth after Silva's pass to make it an even more resounding win in stoppage time .\\nSilva now has more goals than any other non-striker for Spain apart from Fernando Hierro .\",\n          \"\\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 is latest comic book to court controversy .\\nThe just-released issue has plot developments that radically change the Spidey-verse .\\n'Amazing' writer has received extreme reactions, positive and negative, from fans online .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Costa\\u2019s hamstring injury meant Valencia\\u2019s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9.

Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57).

Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down \\u2013 the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain\\u2019s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain\\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors\\u2019 defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score.

Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar \\u2013 this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Bar\\u00e7a\\u2019s B-team last season. His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Costa\\u2019s hamstring injury meant Valencia\\u2019s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9. Dream start: David Silva jumps on to Paco Alcacer's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Macedonia in Valencia . Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57).

Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down \\u2013 the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain\\u2019s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain\\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors\\u2019 defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain \\u2013 of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more.

Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar \\u2013 this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Bar\\u00e7a\\u2019s B-team last season. His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

The child, whose name has not been released, suffered fatal injuries in the incident at Grant Elementary School in Dumont, New Jersey on March 6 and died later that day. On Wednesday, police released a report after an investigation into his death,\\u00a0The Record reported. The fifth-grader had been playing chess with another student during a morning recess period when he became upset that his opponent didn't say 'checkmate', according to the report. An aide overheard him saying to the other student: 'Do you want me to do something drastic?' Tragic: A 10-year-old boy jumped to his death from a window at Grant Elementary School in New Jersey last month after becoming upset following a losing chess match, according to a new police report . She told police that as the students were about to leave the room for lunch, she saw him crying in a corner and writing a note, which he passed to his opponent but told him not to open it until later. She confiscated the note and when she turned around to look at the boy, she saw him climbing through a window before jumping through the second-story window, the report said. He had managed to lift himself onto shelves and had crawled along the top towards the window, which was open about a foot, according to witness statements. He went through the window 'headfirst, unforced, unassisted and of his own accord' and suffered 'serious facial injuries', the report said. Witnesses said the boy seemed to be conscious and moving after hitting the ground but he died in the hospital several hours later, The Record previously reported. The contents of the note he passed to his classmate have not been disclosed. After the tragedy, the classmate said the boy had made references to jumping out the window on four previous occasions - but he didn't tell anyone because he didn't think the boy was serious. After losing another chess match in December, the boy got angry and said, 'I'm this close to jumping out the window!' while holding his thumb and index finger about an inch apart, the classmate said. Upset: The boy had previously told his chess opponent on four separate occasions that he would jump out the window, but the classmate told police he thought the boy was just messing around (stock photo) In the days before he jumped, the boy had also told the lunch aide that no one was letting him play chess with them, so she told the other students to include him. A classmate reported seeing the student often eating lunch on his own. The report concluded that no criminal charges will be brought in the incident. The school has not spoken out about any potential changes to its policies and an attorney for the school declined to comment on Wednesday. But\\u00a0several Dumont High School students said that their school has imposed a new policy that prohibits windows from being opened more than 6 inches, The Record reported. Some of the windows have been fitted with screws that stop them from opening up all the way, the students added. \\u2022 For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . \\u2022 For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .\",\n          \"(CNN)Geography is, in part, destiny for Italy: The country will always be a bridge between Africa and Europe, as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean so starkly shows. A surge of refugees this year, usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels, has sought to reach Europe via the Libyan coast.  A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. Many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of Italy's former colonies in North and East Africa, namely Eritrea (occupied from 1890-1941) and Somalia (1908-1941). As migrants, Libyans are fewer in number, but Libya (1912-1941) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for Italy. Italy's empire never rivaled that of the British and the French in scope and longevity, but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected. Indeed, the migrants traversing the Mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations, expulsions, and exiles sparked by Italy's imperial ambition and commercial interests, the post-colonial anger of African leaders, and now mass economic desperation and political strife. Long after the formal end of Italian colonialism, these Eritreans, Somalis, and Libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. Libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of Italy, on the model of French Algeria, and Libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship's persecution of those who resisted Italian occupation. Over 100,000 Libyan men, women, and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed. Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled from 1969 to 2011, was born during the Italian occupation of his country, and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. This political intervention did not spell the end of Italian-Libyan commercial dealings, which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made Libya Italy's biggest oil supplier. Since 2004, Italy and Libya have been directly connected by the Greenstream natural gas pipeline, which runs below the Mediterranean, on the same axis as many migrant boats. Commercial concerns, and the cozy relationship of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi, also lay behind a historic 2008 Friendship Treaty between Italy and Libya, which promised infrastructure and other aid to Libya worth the equivalent of $5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by Italy during the decades of colonial rule. Until his death in 2011, despite deals with Italy and the European Union to control departures from his borders, Gadhafi intermittently used European fears of mass arrivals of migrants from Libya as a political weapon. Given Europe's geography, this weapon was pointed particularly at Italy, Libya's former master, and the principal target of Gadhafi's post-colonial revenge politics. Few Italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies, even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former Italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise. Upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration, C\\u00e9cile Kyenge, an Italian of Congolese origin, faced ugly racist attacks from fellow Italian politicians, including a comment that she looked like an orangutan. This climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the \\\"heroes\\\" of fascist imperialism. In 2012, the town of Affile built a publicly-funded memorial to General Rodolfo Graziani, known as \\\"the butcher of Fezzan\\\" for his brutal repression of Libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of Ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life. This colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand Italians' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. It is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the Italian Navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist's dictatorship's bid to control the Mediterranean: Mare Nostrum. The program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to European Union budget restrictions. It seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the Italian government to its past aggressions: an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past. At 40 years old, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the Mediterranean. Setting a new course on this issue is in Italy's interest, now more than ever.\",\n          \"Last week Qatar's Constellation Group sensationally snapped up a majority stake in the company that owns Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley Hotel.

What started as a nonthreatening and seemingly shrinking grass fire on Sunday, consuming fewer than 100 acres according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Al Cruz, grew to be more than 10 times that within the next 24 hours. By Monday night, the fire had burned nearly 2,000 acres and was 50% contained, the fire department said. High temperatures and gusty winds helped the fire spread, State Forester Jim Karels said. Several fire units and a helicopter with the capacity to drop 400 gallons of water at a time were battling the blaze, Cruz said. \\\"The Florida Forest Service and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue have worked around the clock to protect Southwest Miami-Dade County,\\\" Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam H. Putnam said in a statement. Early Monday night, officials were considering road closures, and one school, Lincoln Marti, was evacuated as a precaution, according to the Fire Department.\",\n          \"A 30-stone Texan woman has used her eight-foot belly to entice men from around the world, including latest hubby, Lance. Gayla Neufeld, 52, struggled to deal with her family's unusual legacy of piling weight around the midriff for years. But the happy couple, who live in Manitoba, Canada, are now using Gayla's 96-inch asset to launch her new career - as an international webcam model. Scroll down for video . 30 stone Gayla Neufeld met her truck driver husband Lance on a fat-fetish forum . She said: 'Growing up I used to be ashamed of my belly but now I have a great following of men who really like it. 'There have been men from all over the world. I have had doctors, lawyers and even bodybuilders, lots of bodybuilders, approach me, which really amazed me. 'They tell me it's the perfect belly. They say it's not marred or scarred and that they love the shape of it because it is a single belly. Some larger women they have a double-layer or a two-tier belly but mine is a single. That is really attractive to a lot of men.' The 52-year-old says men love her 'perfect belly' and she gets approached by bodybuilders and doctors . Thirty stone Gayla wasn't always so body-confident and for years she struggled to deal with her family's unusual genetic legacy. 'Women in my family have always gained weight around the belly, especially after having children,' said Gayla, whose favourite foods are homemade cookies and ice-cream. 'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother. Gayla inherited her big belly from her family.\\u00a0'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother,' she said . Aged eight, Gayla already weighted 13 stone. She used to get bullied at school and felt ashamed of her weight . 'Growing up, kids at school would point and laugh at me and say \\\"boom, boom, boom\\\" with every step I took. I was really ashamed to be fat.' Aged eight, Gayla already weighed a whopping 13st and continued to pile on even more weight in her teens. One doctor even prescribed her amphetamines to curb her sweet tooth, but it failed and made her even more depressed. Her burgeoning curves made her popular with boys at high school, though, and Gayla had many admirers - but she was too embarrassed at the thought of being naked. Despite her body issues she eventually married at 19 and embarked on a mission to battle the bulge. Gayla's curves attracted boys when she was a teenager, and she married at the age of 19 . However, her husband was embarassed by her size as she continued to pile on the pounds, and they divorced . But instead of maintaining any weight loss, she found herself hovering between 21 and 28 stone. Her wavering confidence was further diminished when her husband said he was embarrassed by her weight and they divorced in 1999. It was at rock-bottom that Gayla discovered an online community of obese women calling themselves SSBBWs - meaning 'super-sized big beautiful women'. These curvaceous women - some in excess of 40 stone - were worshipped by legions of men calling themselves 'fat admirers'. An online community for fat women helped Gayla to embrace her size as she was worshiped by 'fat admirers' Curious to know more, Gayla joined a forum called Bulge Chat and soon found herself overwhelmed with lusty fans. She said: 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was. 'I had always thought the men who liked BBWs would be geeks in their mum's basement, but I was totally wrong.' Despite having her pick it was rugged truck driver Lance Neufield, 54, who really caught her attention. 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was,' said Gayla . After meeting on Bulge Chat they enjoyed two 15-minute conversations and struck up an instant\\u00a0rapport. Lance told her he was driving to Texas with work the following week and they agreed to meet at a truck stop and have dinner. Gayla agreed despite vowing never to fall for anyone again - and she found herself swept off her feet by the Canadian. She said: 'When he pulled up and I saw him I was like, 'Oh my God, he is so cute'. 'He got in the car and he said to me, 'Your pictures online do you no justice'. I was like, 'Aww, that's so sweet' and I just blushed. When Lance and Gayla first met, they stayed up all night talking and smooching on the sofa . 'Years later I found out that his computer didn't produce very good pictures, but it's okay, it still made me feel good at the time. 'We had our first dinner and got a bottle of Champagne afterwards and rented the General's Daughter and The Thomas Crown Affair. 'We didn't get through any of those movies because we stayed up all night talking and smooching on the couch like a couple of kids. 'I was sad when he had to go.' They embarked on a long-distance relationship before Gayla agreed to move to Manitoba, Canada, to be with Lance - and they married six years later. Gayla moved from Texas to Canada to be with Lance, and they married six years later . Despite her size, they claim to enjoy an 'active and satisfying sex life', though Gayla's weight causes other day-to-day obstacles. She struggles to shop for clothes that fit around her 96-inch belly and must use a motorised cart if required to walk long distances. Getting into a car is also an ordeal and she must book two seats on an aeroplane when flying. She has a range of health issues including arthritis and thyroid problems, but remains upbeat about the future. Gayla struggles to walk long distances and has to book two seats on an aeroplane when flying . She said: 'As far as the health aspects go, I don't really worry about them. My mother is still alive and she is 82. 'I have had doctors tell me more then once that I needed to lose weight for health reasons but I truly\\u00a0believe that when it is your time to go, it is your time to go.' Lance, who has three children from a previous relationship, has always been attracted to Gayla's supersize paunch but wouldn't stand in her way if she attempted to lose weight. Gayla's favourite foods are cookies and ice-cream. She says she doesn't worry about health problems . He said: 'This woman is the love of my life. I would 100% support her if she decided to lose weight. 'The first thing that attracted me to her was that she had the most beautiful face I had ever seen. 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty. 'It doesn't matter to me whether it is bigger or smaller because it's not really her belly I love - I love her.' 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty,' says Gayla's latest husband, Lance . With Lance's continuing support Gayla is planning to continue her modelling career and win over even more fans. She said: 'I allowed the world to dictate to me what I was supposed to look like and who I was supposed to be. By taking a body-positive image I have empowered myself to be who I am and to enjoy my life. 'I'm not going to tell you that I never have bad days and I am not going to tell you that I don't wish I was thin from time to time, but mostly I just enjoy being me. 'You've got to love who you are.'\",\n          \"Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet \\u2014 in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves \\u2014 to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius \\u2014 the biggest rabbit on earth \\u2014 and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft . Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st \\u2014 the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record \\u2014 and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record \\u2014 and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff . Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: \\u00a310 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius \\u2014 recently given a clean bill of health by vets \\u2014 seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up \\u2014 it's like lifting a hefty toddler \\u2014 that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them \\u2014 they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models \\u2014 'mostly magazine work' \\u2014 and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto \\u2014 they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked \\u2014 they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving \\u2014 and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition \\u2014 and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise \\u2014 left to their own devices \\u2014 can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . 'That's cruel \\u2014 it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] \\u2014 although it's the damp you should be more worried about \\u2014 it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost \\u00a3500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television \\u2014 including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11449,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The wildfire started in Miami-Dade County on Sunday .\\nBy Monday night, it had grown to nearly 2,000 acres .\\nThe fire was 50% contained, officials said .\",\n          \"30-stone woman's 'perfect belly' attracted men from around the world .\\nGayla Neufeld always struggled with her size, weighing 13 stone aged eight .\\nThe 52-year-old\\u00a0now embraces her belly and works as a webcam model .\\nTexan Gayla met her husband Lance, from Canada, on a fat-fetish forum .\",\n          \"Annette Edwards has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years .\\nShe claims the secret to breeding huge rabbits is both parents must be big .\\nThe former Playboy model has owned the world's largest rabbit since 2008 .\\nHer rabbit Darius is 4ft in length but he will soon be eclipsed by his son .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Costa\\u2019s hamstring injury meant Valencia\\u2019s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9.

Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down \\u2013 the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain\\u2019s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain\\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors\\u2019 defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score.

It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar \\u2013 this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Bar\\u00e7a\\u2019s B-team last season.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \\u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \\u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\\u2019\",\n          \"The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is attempting to regain control of a spaceship that is spinning out of control in orbit. Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 am EDT (07:09 GMT)\\u00a0from  Kazakhstan. It was due to dock with the ISS six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'. Scroll down for video . Nasa's reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate' 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control. Orbital parameters were due to be sent from a Russian Ground Site, allowing for a eight 'rendevous burns' to be performed over the next five hours of flight. But, once Progress had arrived on orbit, only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made. Meanwhile, Nasa's Mission Control reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate.' Roscosmos' problems began shortly after a Russian Soyuz 2-1A rocket launched the Progress resupply vehicle. Orbital data was due to be sent from a Russian Ground Site, allowing for a eight 'rendezvous burns' to be performed over the next five hours of flight. But, once Progress had arrived on orbit, only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made. Meanwhile, Nasa's Mission Control reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate.' The dizzying footage, which was taken from the Progress 59 spacecraft, shows the Earth and sun moving in and out of the frame. 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control. 'No confirmation of navigational antenna deploy or of the pressurisation of the manifold system for the propulsion system on the spacecraft was received.' Russian spacecraft, including those used to send astronauts to the ISS, recently have acquired the capability to take a more direct six-hour route to the orbiting outpost. But they still have the option of the longer, traditional route lasting two days. 'The crew on board the International Space Station has pressed ahead with maintenance work today as well as biomedical experiment activities,' said Navias. Roscosmos' problems began shortly after a Russian Soyuz 2-1A rocket launched the latest Progress resupply vehicle to the ISS.\\u00a0'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control . Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Docking with the ISS has been abandoned . It was unclear how long Progress could keep orbiting the Earth while Russian flight controllers tried to stabilise the craft and restore the system that allows them to send and receive data. Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Because of the loss of connection, the flight controllers were unable to confirm the deployment of the navigational antennas needed for docking, a duty officer at Russia's Mission Control said. Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy. The dizzying footage (pictured), which was taken from the Progress 59 spacecraft, shows the Earth and sun moving in and out of the frame . The spacecraft was scheduled to dock with the International Space Station six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'. \\u00a0Pictured a cargo ship in the same family,\\u00a0Progress M-59, as seen from the International Space Station (right) during docking . Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 a.m. EDT (07:09 GMT) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . 'Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight, Nasa said in a statement. The cargo ship also is delivering a copy of the Banner of Victory, the banner raised over the Reichstag in Berlin by victorious Soviet soldiers in 1945. Russia is planning extensive celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Nasa is now having to rely on a single cargo shipper, SpaceX. Its other supplier, Orbital Sciences, is still grounded following a launch explosion last October at Virginia. The potential loss of an entire load of supplies on Progress is a serious blow to the International Space Station. The cargo ship launched this morning on a Soyuz 2-1A rocket (pictured). \\u00a0Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy .\",\n          \"(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to \\\"gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,\\\" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward \\\"other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,\\\" according to the commission. \\\"PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,\\\" commission President Michael Picker said. \\\"The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\\\" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. \\\"Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,\\\" Tony Earley said. \\\"We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten.\\\" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \\u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \\u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\\u2019\",\n          \"The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is attempting to regain control of a spaceship that is spinning out of control in orbit. Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 am EDT (07:09 GMT)\\u00a0from  Kazakhstan. It was due to dock with the ISS six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'. Scroll down for video . Nasa's reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate' 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control. Orbital parameters were due to be sent from a Russian Ground Site, allowing for a eight 'rendevous burns' to be performed over the next five hours of flight. But, once Progress had arrived on orbit, only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made. Meanwhile, Nasa's Mission Control reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate.' Roscosmos' problems began shortly after a Russian Soyuz 2-1A rocket launched the Progress resupply vehicle. Orbital data was due to be sent from a Russian Ground Site, allowing for a eight 'rendezvous burns' to be performed over the next five hours of flight. But, once Progress had arrived on orbit, only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made. Meanwhile, Nasa's Mission Control reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate.' The dizzying footage, which was taken from the Progress 59 spacecraft, shows the Earth and sun moving in and out of the frame. 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control. 'No confirmation of navigational antenna deploy or of the pressurisation of the manifold system for the propulsion system on the spacecraft was received.' Russian spacecraft, including those used to send astronauts to the ISS, recently have acquired the capability to take a more direct six-hour route to the orbiting outpost. But they still have the option of the longer, traditional route lasting two days. 'The crew on board the International Space Station has pressed ahead with maintenance work today as well as biomedical experiment activities,' said Navias. Roscosmos' problems began shortly after a Russian Soyuz 2-1A rocket launched the latest Progress resupply vehicle to the ISS.\\u00a0'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control . Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Docking with the ISS has been abandoned . It was unclear how long Progress could keep orbiting the Earth while Russian flight controllers tried to stabilise the craft and restore the system that allows them to send and receive data. Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Because of the loss of connection, the flight controllers were unable to confirm the deployment of the navigational antennas needed for docking, a duty officer at Russia's Mission Control said. Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy. The dizzying footage (pictured), which was taken from the Progress 59 spacecraft, shows the Earth and sun moving in and out of the frame . The spacecraft was scheduled to dock with the International Space Station six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'. \\u00a0Pictured a cargo ship in the same family,\\u00a0Progress M-59, as seen from the International Space Station (right) during docking . Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 a.m. EDT (07:09 GMT) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . 'Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight, Nasa said in a statement. The cargo ship also is delivering a copy of the Banner of Victory, the banner raised over the Reichstag in Berlin by victorious Soviet soldiers in 1945. Russia is planning extensive celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Nasa is now having to rely on a single cargo shipper, SpaceX. Its other supplier, Orbital Sciences, is still grounded following a launch explosion last October at Virginia. The potential loss of an entire load of supplies on Progress is a serious blow to the International Space Station. The cargo ship launched this morning on a Soyuz 2-1A rocket (pictured). \\u00a0Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy .\",\n          \"(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to \\\"gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,\\\" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward \\\"other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,\\\" according to the commission. \\\"PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,\\\" commission President Michael Picker said. \\\"The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\\\" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. \\\"Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,\\\" Tony Earley said. \\\"We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten.\\\" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.
